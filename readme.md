# Local HTML Gallery

## Usage

- create a folder `images` in root dir. Paste pictures there.

- run `scan.py` to update script.js so it knows every picture. 

(For security reasons javascript cannot scan the entire `images` folder. That's why we need `scan.py`)

- open index.html. or open with your software. For example, html background in FL Studio.

## Customize

The first line of  `script.js` should NEVER be edited by your hand. Vital parameters to be modified are other global constant values.
